### User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I’d like to fill out a working form so that I can submit my information effectively and without issues.  
🐿️ As a user, I want the application to work as expected on my mobile device so that I can access and use it conveniently on the go.  
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API GET route so that I can retrieve data from the server and display it to the users.  
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API POST route so that users can send data to the server and store it.  
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create and seed a database with dummy data so that I have realistic test data for development purposes.

### Requirements

🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.  
🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or dynamic CSS styling.  
🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.  
🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.  
🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.
